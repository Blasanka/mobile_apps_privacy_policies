## Shares Assistant: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Shares Assistant app for Android!

This is an simple mobile Android app developed by B Liyanage Asanka to calculate share buy & sell profit calculation. The app is also available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences (like theme, etc.) and profit loss calculation) created by the you is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
Asanka BL.
